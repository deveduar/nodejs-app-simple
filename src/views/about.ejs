        <p>
          Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in front-end and back-end development, allowing me to tackle complex projects with ease. I am well-versed in leveraging JavaScript frameworks like React to build interactive and responsive user interfaces. Additionally, my expertise in Node.js enables me to develop efficient and scalable server-side applications.
          As a lifelong learner, I am committed to continuously expanding my knowledge and staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies. I actively explore new tools and frameworks, always striving to deliver cutting-edge solutions that push the boundaries of web development.
